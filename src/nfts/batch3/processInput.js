    `This Lil Noun Spirited Vodka is the inaugural launch NFT of Liquid Collections.
This is the first in a series of exclusive, collectible ultra-premium spirits made in collaboration with artists. Launching with a unique Lil Noun, Liquid Collections created a ghostly-inspired, limited-edition vodka, only available via NFT.
Made of locally sourced winter wheat from a farm in Washington state, this Spirited vodka has been artisanally crafted, triple-distilled, and freeze-filtered before being blended with ultra-pure water from the Cascade mountain range.
